    <h1>Welcome to the page for Matthew Whitaker's Eagle Project</h1>
    There are two options for participating in my eagle project: in person, or watching live. To watch classes live, view the schedule below, and click watch live to view the live stream of the classes.<br />
    If you would like to come to the class in person, please show up at the Family History Center at 420 South Main, Spanish Fork, UT. Please arrive no later than 15 minutes before the class starts according to the live schedule.<br />
    It is recommended that you have a FamilySearch account before coming to or watching any of the classes. If you do not have an account, please bring your temple recommend with you to the class, or if watching the classes live, watch the introduction video that will be uploaded on Sunday the 23rd of April.
